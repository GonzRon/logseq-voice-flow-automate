4. Configure the plugin settings as needed

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Record or add an audio file to a Logseq block

3. The plugin will:
   - Transcribe the audio using AI
   - Generate an AI title for the content
   - Create a new Logseq page with:
     - The transcription under "# Transcription"
     - An AI summary under "# Summary"
     - Additional sections for Tasks and Notes
   - Parse tags and instructions
   - Create tasks in Todoist (if #todo tag is present)
   - Add a reference to the new page in the original block

### Page Structure

Each created page includes:

```markdown
---
tags:: #voice-note #transcription
created:: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
source:: [[Original Page Name]]
---

# Transcription
[Full transcription of your voice note]

# Summary
[AI-generated summary of the key points]

# Tasks
[List of tasks if #todo tag was used]

# Notes
[Space for your additional notes]
```

### Tag Commands

- `#todo` - Triggers todo creation in Todoist
- `#ai` - Use AI summarization for task extraction
- `#direct` or `#literal` - Use literal transcription without AI processing
